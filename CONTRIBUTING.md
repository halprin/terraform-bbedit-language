# I accept PRs!

Please feel free to contribute enhancements!  Create a fork and make a PR.

If you do, please provide a meaningful title and description in the PR.  Update the `README.md` if it is affected by your change.

# Oh no, there's something wrong.

Please file an issue!  If you do, please provide a meaningful title, what you expected, what actually happened, what version of BBEdit you are using, and an example Terraform file that exhibits the issue.

This work is on the backburner for me, so I would encourge you to subsequently fix the issue if you can and create a PR.
